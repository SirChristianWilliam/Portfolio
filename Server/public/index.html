            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my page!
                I'm twenty-seven years old and I have been professionally coding/programming for over
                two years now. I began my journey as a Software Developer back
                when I was ten years old, creating fun beginner projects on
                <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, a website that
                teaches young children the basics of code. I love learning and
                broadening my mind and skillset, which is why I transitioned out
                of the service industry to pursue something that would challenge me
                every day. Outside of my passion for problem solving, I also have a passion
                for people. I love sports, making new friends, and learning about
                different cultures. I'm a healthy mix of not too extroverted
                and not too introverted, which I feel aids in empathy being a strong trait of mine.
                I enjoy reading fantasy novels, rock climbing, comedy shows,
                watching movies that are so bad that they're good, and pretty much
                anything that gets me outside. You'll notice I've included examples
                of past projects I've made that I'm proud to showcase to you. Please feel free to look around!
            </p>

            <h1>Currently</h1>
            <p id="myJourneyP">
                Since August 15th, I have been attending an accelerated
                learning program called <a href="http://www.primeacademy.io">Prime Digital Academy</a>. I have
                gained an absolutely insane amount of knowledge in a relatively short amount of time.
                Some of what I've been taught includes: Javascript, React, Redux, C#, Postico, Postman,
                Jquery, PostgreSQL, Figma, Git/Github, VScode, AWS, Heroku, MUI,
                Node, npm, entity relationships, server/client side communications, Slack and Zoom communications,
                peer review, debugging, problem solving, group projects, and more. I've been putting in
                60+ hours per week since August and have been loving every minute of it.
                Time management is definitely a skill I've honed well! Follow the links to
                my github if you'd like to see the quality and volume of projects I've been
                creating. I'm very proud of my most recent
                project, "Missing Link"...â¬‡

                                My dad died from ALS in 2020. I spent
                                countless hours researching the disease. However much I
                                looked, I was never satisfied with the results. What I realized
                                is that there is nowhere that explains anything about the <span class="person">PERSON</span>
                                who has ALS. There are symptoms, and plenty of websites telling
                                you how there's no cure, but nothing to draw any real conclusions
                                of what could potentially cause it in the first place. That's why I
                                created Missing Link. Any user who has been diagnosed with a disease
                                or condition will be given an access code from their doctor. On my website,
                                they will then search up the condition they have and enter the code
                                for it. The user will have a profile page where they can navigate to
                                the questions page. This page is intended to have hundreds if not
                                thousands of questions. The questions encompass the user's symptoms, but
                                more importantly, data about the user themselves. Hair color, what city they grew up,
                                how many hours of sleep they get per night, do they drink coffee, or
                                alcohol, or smoke marijuana. Individually, these questions are seemingly
                                unimportant. However, if hundreds of thousands of users are diagnosed
                                with ALS and answer these questions, there is a possibility of discovering
                                a connection, or "missing link" between users for that particular condition.
                                On the results page, if one user's question/answer pair is identical to
                                another user's question/answer pair, that row will be combined and the match count
                                will increase by 1. This allows compression of the data and provides an excellent
                                filter to compare amongst the users. This app has a lot of real-world
                                potential, and I do hope to expand on it over the years until it's production ready.
                                Imagine if 90% of those with ALS had all started drinking alcohol before the age
                                of ten. How would we know this? Why would anyone even think to ask that question
                                of each patient? Missing Link is aptly named as it's looking for just that, for finding
                                those odd connections in an attempt to lead researchers in new directions,
                                as the old ones haven't been working.

                            Sometimes simplicity is what the client wants. Most people wouldn't expect
                               a heavily styled survey page, so I kept this one minimal. This project was 
                               focused on learning the power of single-page-applications, and how a user 
                               will be able to navigate around the site by dynamically rewriting the content 
                               based off of the actions the user inputs. I value this project, and any project, 
                               that is often applied to real-world businesses and a scenarios. A survey page 
                               is very valuable for business owners to understand the needs of their clients and 
                               users.
